# AWS Backup Plan
## A simple Command line driven AWS backup script written in PHP to run from a cron job 

The purpose of this script is to perform (hourly) periodic backups of some EC2 EBS volume, and to keep some subset of those backups representing a useful set of times and dates for rolling back or diagnosing issues.
